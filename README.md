# Capstone-SaveVacciDose
This project code was designed to solve the problem of enabling the general public to book for vaccines before going out to wastage.
The vaccine doses available are unique for each day and have a certain amount of time available for use before disposal on the very same day.
The public can book for vaccines, added to waiting list, when approved can set up an appointment for the vaccine jab.

The main implemented java code for the project can be found by navigating to:
./vaccinewastemitigationapp/app/src/main/java/com/example/vaccinewastemitigationapp/
